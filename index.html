            <p>
                <strong>Inventory Turnover</strong>, in this particular case is measured in days
                showing the period of time needed to empty a warehouse.
            </p>
            <p>
                First of all, we extract <strong>raw</strong> data from <strong>ERP</strong>. This
                data represents inventory state and changes between 10/2019 and 12/2019 for
                particular items. The raw data is saved in format of text file with such columns:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Date</li>
                <li>Nomenclature name</li>
                <li>Nomenclature group</li>
                <li>
                    Quantitatively:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Opening balance</li>
                        <li>Increase</li>
                        <li>Decrease</li>
                        <li>Closing balance</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Summarily:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Opening balance</li>
                        <li>Increase</li>
                        <li>Decrease</li>
                        <li>Closing balance</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <a href="DemoData.txt" download>Raw data file</a>
            <p>
                Raw data records exist at the date the changes occur. In order to calculate the
                average balance correctly it is needed to expand raw data records to cover the days
                without changes
            </p>
            <p>We will transform the data with a simple <strong>Python</strong> script</p>

            <a href="DemoData_expanded.txt" download>Transformed data file</a>
            <p>
                We load the transformed data into <strong>Power BI</strong> and create the necessary
                measurements there. The final visualization can be viewed in
                <strong>Power BI Desktop</strong>

            <p>
                You can explore data on this chart by selecting Date, month, Group or single Item,
                and all KPI's will updates. In this case <strong>Inventory Turnover</strong> rate is
                equal to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>0..5 days - <span class="rate_hi">High</span></li>
                <li>5..20 days - <span class="rate_normal">Normal</span></li>
                <li>20..50 days - <span class="rate_lo">Low</span></li>
                <li>50.. days - <span class="rate_critical">Critical</span></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                The right-side chart represents <strong>average inventory cost</strong> by groups.
                Each group is highlighted by specific color wich relates to particular Inventory
                Turnover rate. So, it is possible to observe two big groups with "Low" performance.
            </p>
            <img src="screenshot_02.jpg" alt="First group" />
            <img src="screenshot_03.jpg" alt="Second group" />
            <p>
                And take a look on the last month.
            </p>
            <img src="screenshot_04.jpg" alt="Last mont" />
            <p>
                "High" rated positions also can be interesting.
            </p>
            <img src="screenshot_05.jpg" alt="Hi rated" />
            <p>
                Resume:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Such visualization let you clearly understand total value of Inventory turnover
                    indicator, its changes over time and its relationship with inventory cost. Also
                    visualization is efficient tool in detecting the groups or single items with
                    "low" performance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In last month Inventory Turnover stabilized due to the efficient tools which
                    company used during that period of time
                </li>
                <li>
                    However, company still have to work on with some particular items. One must
                    understand whole context to give recommendations, but common's: lower prices,
                    make some specific ADS.
                </li>
                <li>
                    From the other side, we can deal with "High" positions. Rise price, combine with
                    "Low" rated items, etc.
                </li>
            </ol>
